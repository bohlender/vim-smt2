# Extended SMT-LIB2 support for Vim
![Example](/example.png?raw=true "Example")

## What is this?
A Vim plugin that provides syntax highlighting and common operations for working with [SMT-LIB2](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/) files (`*.smt2`).

Although SMT-LIB2 is the standard language supported by most [SMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories) solvers, some of them introduce custom language extensions.
Such extensions may range from syntactical sugar to fine-grained control over the underlying solver-procedure.
Besides the base SMT-LIB2 language, this plugin also **supports the extensions of [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)**.

*Note: To provide a familiar experience, the syntax highlighting is directly derived from the source of [Z3's online demo](https://rise4fun.com/Z3/).*

**Without an SMT solver** being installed, both the highlighting and the following shortcuts will be available:
* `<localleader>f` auto-formats the current paragraph (uses `vim9script` and requires Vim >= v8.2.2725)
* `<localleader>F` auto-formats the current buffer/file (uses `vim9script` and requires Vim >= v8.2.2725)

**With an SMT solver** of your choice being installed (*defaults to [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) or [boolector](http://fmv.jku.at/boolector)*), the following shortcuts will also be available:
* `<localleader>r` evaluates the current file (in a terminal)
* `<localleader>R` evaluates the current file and puts the output in a new split with syntax highlighting
* `<localleader>v` prints the solver's version (handy if you switch often)

*Note: Unless you've set `<localleader>` to a custom key, it is `\` (Vim default).*

## Installation

| Plugin Manager | Instructions |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) | <ol><li>`cd ~/.vim/bundle`</li><li>`git clone https://github.com/bohlender/vim-smt2`</li></ol> |
| [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) | <ol><li>add `Plugin 'bohlender/vim-smt2'` to your `~/.vimrc` file (*before `call vundle#end()`*)</li><li>reload your `~/.vimrc` or restart Vim</li><li>run `:PluginInstall` in Vim</li></ol> |
| manual (discouraged) | Extract the archive or clone the repository into a directory in your `runtimepath` (e.g. `~/.vim/`): <ol><li>`cd ~/.vim/`</li><li>`curl -L https://github.com/bohlender/vim-smt2/tarball/master \| tar xz --strip 1`</li></ol> |

## Configuration
**If you only care about the syntax highlighting or auto-formatting**,  i.e. you don't need to invoke a solver, **you're done**.
However, you can tweak the auto-formatting as follows:
* `let g:smt2_formatter_short_length = 80` defines the length of "short" S-expressions -- these are formatted without line breaks
* `let g:smt2_formatter_indent_str = "  "` defines two spaces as the string to use for indentation

**To use the solver-oriented commands**, you need to:
* have `z3` or `boolector` in your `$PATH`, **or**
* set `g:smt2_solver_command` in your `~/.vimrc` to the command for calling the solver of your choice (e.g. `let g:smt2_solver_command="boolector -m"`) and also
* set `g:smt2_solver_version_switch` to the solver's command line switch for printing it's version (default: `--version`).

### Customize the shortcuts
The plugin uses `<Plug>` mappings to make it possible for you to override them. The following table lists the plugin's exposed functions:
| Function | Default mapping |
| -------- | --------------- |
|`<Plug>Smt2Run`|`<localleader>r`|
|`<Plug>Smt2RunAndShowResult`|`<localleader>R`|
|`<Plug>Smt2PrintVersion`|`<localleader>v`|
|`<Plug>Smt2FormatCurrentParagraph`|`<localleader>f`|
|`<Plug>Smt2FormatOutermostSExpr`|  |
|`<Plug>Smt2FormatFile`|`<localleader>F`|

For example, if you want to make `<localleader>f` format the outermost S-expression instead of the current paragraph, simply add
```
nmap <leader>f <Plug>Smt2FormatOutermostSExpr
```
to your `~/.vimrc`.

## FAQ
> Why does Vim  not show any syntax highlighting - neither for `*.smt2` files nor for others?

Most likely syntax highlighting is simply disabled.
You can enable syntax highlighting by typing `:syntax on` in Vim or adding `syntax on` to your `~/.vimrc` file.

> Why does the ending of a file, e.g. `*.smt2`, not affect the plugins loaded by Vim?

Make sure that you have filetype plugins enabled. See [|filetype-plugin-on|](https://vimhelp.org/filetype.txt.html#%3Afiletype-plugin-on) for details, or simply add the following to your `~/.vimrc`:
```
filetype plugin on
```

> What do you use to get the look shown on the screenshot?

The screenshot was made with the Vim colorscheme [monokai](https://github.com/crusoexia/vim-monokai) and the [airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) standard theme `dark`.
